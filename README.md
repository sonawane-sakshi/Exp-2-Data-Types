<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>C++ program structure is built around various data types, which define the kind of data a variable can hold. These data types include fundamental types like `int`, `float`, `char`, and `bool`, along with user-defined types such as `structs`, `enums`, and `classes`. Understanding and using these data types efficiently is essential for writing effective and optimized C++ programs.There are Different data types in cpp which contains different size in bytes and required differnt amount of meoery to store its values.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Through our exploration of C++ data types, we demonstrated how different types dictate the storage and behavior of data in a program. This experiment highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate data types for efficient memory use and program functionality.</p>
